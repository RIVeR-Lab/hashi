# General Guidlines

HASHI as presented in the paper was comprised of 3D printed parts, lasercut acrylic, commercially-available hardware, and then electromechanical components. The 3D printed parts were printed in CF-Nylon on a Markforged X7, however they were first prototyped in PLA on a standard FDM printer. PLA is fine as a research platform, at the cost of some robustness due to the slightly compliant nature of CF-Nylon. Keep in mind that all tolerances for the CAD design were chosen with Markforged-level dimensional accuracy in mind, and may need to be adjusted by hand in the CAD, or after printing.
