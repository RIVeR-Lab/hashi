# HASHI: Highly Adaptable Seafood Handling Instrument

HASHI is trying to solve problems with seafood manipulation in a food processing setting

>TODO: INSERT PICTURE HERE

## Problems

Food has a huge variance in size, shape, and texture, and can also be quite fragile

Damaging foodstuffs during the processing stage is paramount to reducing waste and expenses while maximizing profit

## Contributions

- Development of open-source hardware and software for a chopstick-like end effector for deformable food manipulation
- Kinematic modeling for control of said mechanism and experimental verification of the models
- Demonstration of a dual-chopstick gripper for the manipulation of food items of various size,  hardness, and weight
